# RustiCo-V
Simple C compiler written in Rust. The assembly generated will be RISC-V assembly.

This is a personal project to learn compiler basics. Both lexer and parser are written from scratch.
Currently the only supported type of programs are of type:

"int main() { return 0; }"

Assembly generation coming soon.
Full of TODOs and temporary solutions.
